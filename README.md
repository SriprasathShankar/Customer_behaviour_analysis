# Customer_behaviour_analysis
Data Analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL,  and Power BI

📊 Data Pipeline and Customer Insights Dashboard

1\. ✨ Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis pipeline, starting from raw data processing in Python, transitioning to a relational database (MySQL) for complex queries, and culminating in an interactive visualization dashboard (Power BI).

The main objective was to transform raw sales and customer data into actionable insights for the business and identify key drivers of customer value.

2\. 📁 Dataset

| Feature | Description |
| Source: | `[Insert Dataset Source, e.g., Kaggle, Company Simulation]` |
| Size: | `[Insert Number of Rows]` rows, `[Insert Number of Columns]` columns |
| Focus: | Sales transactions, customer demographics, and order details. |

3\. 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

| Category | Tools Used |
| Analysis & Scripting | Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) |
| Data Storage & Querying | MySQL |
| Data Modeling & Visualization | Power BI Desktop |
| Notebook Environment | Jupyter Notebook |

4\. 📝 Project Steps and Methodology

The project was executed in a clear, four-stage pipeline:
A. Data Loading & Cleaning (Python)

  * Loaded the raw CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
  * Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to check distributions, identify outliers, and assess data quality.
  * Handled missing values (`NaN`) through imputation or removal.
  * Standardized text formats and corrected data types (e.g., converting strings to datetime objects).

B. Database Integration (MySQL)

  * Designed a normalized schema to separate data into multiple tables (e.g., `customers`, `orders`, `products`).
  * Used a Python script (`mysql.connector`) to efficiently **load the cleaned data** from the DataFrame into the prepared MySQL tables.
  * Executed complex SQL queries to join tables, calculate key metrics, and prepare aggregated data for visualization.

C. Metric Calculation & Analysis

Key analysis and metrics calculated include:

  * Customer Revenue: Total revenue generated by individual customers.
  * Order Frequency: Average number of orders per month.
  * Product Performance: Top-selling products by volume and revenue.
  * Geographic Analysis: Revenue split by region.

D. Power BI Dashboard Development

  * Connected Power BI directly to the MySQL database tables.
  * Built a robust Data Model with appropriate relationships between the `customers`, `orders`, and `products` tables.
  * Created calculated measures (DAX) for dynamic reporting (e.g., Year-over-Year Growth).

5\. 🖥️ Final Dashboard and Key Insights

The final Power BI dashboard provides an interactive interface for exploring customer behavior.

| Insight Found | Business Implication |
| [X]% of revenue generated by the Top 10% of customers. | Focus retention efforts on high-value customers. |
| The `[Specific Product Category]` product saw a [Y]% spike in Q3. | Identify and capitalize on seasonal demand factors. |
| Customer churn is highest in the `[Specific Region]`. | Investigate local shipping or competition issues. |

6\. ▶️ How to Run This Project

To replicate this analysis pipeline locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the Repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repository Name]
    ```

2.  Setup MySQL:

      * Ensure your MySQL Server is running.
      * Create a database named `[Your Database Name]` (e.g., `data_project`).
      * Use the provided `setup_tables.sql` file to create the empty `customers` and `orders` tables.

3.  Run the Python Script:

      * Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `pandas`, `mysql-connector-python`).
      * Open and run the `data_cleaning_and_load.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. This script will clean the data and load it into your MySQL tables.

4.  Open the Power BI File:

      * Open the `[Your File Name].pbix` file.
      * You may need to update the data source settings to point the connection to your local MySQL instance (`127.0.0.1`) and enter your credentials.
